# Freelancing-project-1
This was my first freelancing project using python programming language 
Task 1
In Task 1, I load data from a CSV file ("sales_data.csv") using the Pandas library to create a DataFrame. I also check the sample data, display column names, shape, and check for any missing values in the DataFrame.

Task 2
In Task 2, I load the same CSV data using NumPy's genfromtxt function. I then perform the following calculations:

Calculate the total number of products sold (number of rows in the dataset).
Calculate the total revenue generated by summing the "Revenue" column.
Calculate the average price per product by finding the mean of the "Price" column.
Identify the most expensive product by finding the product ID with the highest price.
Task 3
In Task 3, I analyze the data to find the top-selling product category:

Calculate the sales quantity for each category.
Find the index of the category with the highest sales quantity.
Get the name of the top-selling product category.
Task 4
In Task 4, I filter the dataset to include only rows where the quantity sold is greater than or equal to 10. This filtered data is then saved as a new CSV file named "filtered_data.csv."

Task 5
In Task 5, I take the filtered dataset created in Task 4 and calculate the total revenue generated by summing the "Revenue" column of the filtered data.

Task 6
In Task 6, I continue working with the filtered dataset from Task 4 and calculate the average price per product by finding the mean of the "Price" column of the filtered data.

Task 7
In Task 7, I create a scatter plot using Matplotlib. This scatter plot displays the revenue generated by each product category. Each category is represented by a different color, and the plot shows the relationship between product IDs and revenue for each category.

The code provides an analysis of sales data, including basic statistics, filtering, and visualization of product categories. The tasks are executed step by step, and the results are printed to the console or displayed in a plot.
